# Advent of Code❄️
### Welcome to my Advent of Code (AoC) puzzle solutions repository!

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. Every day throughout the month of December, a new puzzle is released, challenging participants to come up with creative solutions.

In this repository, you will find my finished and unfinished solutions for different years. Each year, I pick a different programming language to tackle the puzzles, allowing me to explore and learn new concepts along the way.

## Participations:
- **2023**: Python
- **2022**: Rust
- **2021**: Kotlin
- **2020**: C#

My primary goal is not to be the first on any leaderboard; instead, I prioritize having fun while solving these coding puzzles and experimenting with various techniques. To enhance the learning experience, I try to include explanations of my thinking process in the solutions.

Feel free to explore the solutions for each year and language. If you're interested in joining the Advent of Code challenge or learning more about the puzzles, visit the official website at https://adventofcode.com/.
